# Maze Generation using DFS in Python

This project demonstrates how to generate a maze using the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm in Python. The maze is represented as a grid, where walls and paths are created based on the DFS traversal.

## Introduction

The Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm is a fundamental graph traversal technique that can be used to generate mazes. By treating the maze as a grid and performing a DFS traversal, we can carve out a path from the starting point to the ending point, creating a solvable maze.

## Installation
1. Install VS Code or Pycharm
   
2.  Make sure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
    
3.  Clone this repository or download the source code.
    
4.  Install any required libraries (if any) using pip:
    
    bash
    
    `pip install pygame` 
    

## Usage

To generate a maze, simply run the script `maze.py`. You can specify the dimensions of the maze as command-line arguments:

bash

`py maze.py`
