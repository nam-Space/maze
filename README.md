# Maze Generation using DFS in Python

This project demonstrates how to generate a maze and find a path using the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm in Python. The maze is represented as a grid, where walls and paths are created based on the DFS traversal.

## Introduction

The Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm is a fundamental graph traversal technique that can be used to generate mazes. By treating the maze as a grid and performing a DFS traversal, we can carve out a path from the starting point to the ending point, creating a solvable maze.

## Installation

1. Install VS Code or Pycharm
2. Make sure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
3. Clone this repository or download the source code.
4. Install any required libraries (if any) using pip:

    bash

    `pip install pygame`

## Running

To generate a maze, simply run the script `maze.py`. You can specify the dimensions of the maze as command-line arguments:

bash

`py maze.py`

## Result

Enter your width, height and speed you want to customize. Hope you enjoy!
